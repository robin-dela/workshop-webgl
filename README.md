threejs-starter-kit
===================

It uses Three.js and Greensock as depencies.
I also added Wagner for post-processing.

After cloning install all dependencies :
```bash
npm i
```

## Task
### Start development
It starts devlopement server at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), browser-sync and watch files.
```bash
npm start
```
### Prepare for deploy
```bash
npm run build
```

You are good to go !
